## Media
We have an Apple TV hooked up to the tv, so look for the little silver remote to use it. If you have an apple computer, the air play is actually really good when using the tv as a "second monitor" to watch youtube with adblock on.  

Feel free to use any of our streaming services! 

There's also a Jellyfin app, which we host and have our own media on. Feel free to check out what's on there too! 
## Chargers
In the Kalax in the corner, the cube that has two drawers, the top drawers is for cables. It might have some blocks too, both for usb and usb-c
## Games
We've (obviously) got board games on the bookshelf. 

We leave a Nintendo Switch dock under the tv too. 
We usually just move the hdmi cable from the apple tv over to the switch dock when we use it.
And we usually just steal one fo the macbook chargers for power too.  
## Extra blankets
There's a heated blanket in the upper right of the Kalax (if I didn't leave it out somewhere for Persy).

Check the downstairs closet for more, and if there are none there, they could be in the bedroom either in or on the white roll out chest.
