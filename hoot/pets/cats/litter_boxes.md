## Extra Litter
We pour their normal litter into the petco buckets, and normally keep one of those next to/close by each box. 
## Disposal
I use the litter Champ brand, but it's the same as Litter Genie. Step on the lever, and press the scoop down onto the plate to drop them in. 

There are instructions for how to empty it on the inside of the little doors. 

If, god forbid, the infini-bag runs out in there, we keep refills all over the house: 
* in the upstairs closet
* in the hallway closet upstairs (end of the hall)
* in the dresser next to the downstairs box
* in the kitchen cabinet under the toaster

If you do have to empty it, you are good to throw the bag right in the green trash can outside. 

## Brand
Dr. Elsies multi cat (dark blue color)

We have to be careful about brand and stick to low dust, because Corri has sensitive lungs and Persy struggles in general due to a lack of eyelashes.
