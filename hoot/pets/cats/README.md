## Playing
There are a mess of mouse/crinkle ball/etc type toys in the Kallax in the living room, upper left hand corner. 

Then there are feather wands in the hallway closet, hanging on the door. 

While they all love to play, they tend to need to be isolated to play (We'll usually close the bedroom door and play with one cat at a time on the bed). 

Very old lady who swallowed a fly: Persy is intimidated by Corrigan so she won't play when he's around. Then Corrigan is intimidated by Shark Bait, and so he in turn won't play if Shark Bait is around....   

## Catnip
We keep a big jug of it on the kitchen counter between the sink and the stove. We put soft toys in there to really intensify their catnip-i-ness. 

Persy in particular likes just a pile of the dried nip, and will rub on it/lick it/huff it. 

BUT!!!! Because she rubs on it you have to make sure not to put it on anything too rough. She has injured herself on the cat-scratcher arm cover on the living room couch.
