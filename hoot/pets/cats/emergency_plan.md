# Emergency Plan 

We have soft sided carriers for all 3 cats downstairs, next to the gas stove. 

If there's some lead time, Corrigan should get given Gabepentin. We normally empty a capsule into a wet food treat 1-2 hours beforehand. 

If it's cold weather, throw a towel or something in with Persy so she doesn't freeze.
