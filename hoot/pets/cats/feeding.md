## Normal Times
Normally, we feed everyone at 7am and 7pm. But we are only strict about it because if we feed dinner early, Corrigan will wake you up for breakfast that much earlier. 

If no one is home for him to be a bastard to at 5AM or earlier, feel free to feed whenever. 

## Where are...
We keep the cans of wet food in the tall cabinet. The boys will probably be pawing it it to let you know anyways. 

The bowls are also in that same cabinet normally. If all of them are dirty, just use any old dish. 

## Technique
Persephone gets 1/2 a can in the morning and 1 full can at night. The boys each get 1/2 a can, morning and night. 

Persy is a slow eater and Corrigan is a bully, so everyone gets fed separately. In order:

1. We close Corrigan into Midgie's office 
1. Shark Bait gets put into the upstairs bathroom (sometimes he needs to get gently placed in there... he is smart enough to know it's a trap)
1. Then Persy can be fed wherever with the boys locked away. When Plover is home, we feed her up on the catwalk so that the dog doesn't stress her out.  

Whenever Persy has finished, we let the boys out. She doesn't always eat her whole can at night, so it's not a big deal if she leaves some for the boys. 

But she _does_ sometimes take like 1 single bite, then away from it to use the litterbox while she knows the boys aren't around to bully her, then circle back and finish... so keep an eye out for that.

## Allergies
### Persy
Absolutely no fish, she breaks out in a full body rash. We avoid chicken and turkey, also cause rashes. 

We try and avoid wheat, as it makes for a bad litterbox situation, but it's not the end of the world if she has some.  

### Shark Bait
He is definitely allergic to something... At time of writing, we are trying to figure out what. 
We avoid chicken, turkey & fish entirely. We thought Duck was fine, but he started reacting to his duck food recently.

Historically we have had no problems with beef based treats.
### Corrigan
None, lucky thing.
## Treats
Currently, we stick to feeding duck based treats. We keep some duck jerky that everyone can have (broken into tiny pieces) in the hutch in the dining room. 

They can also have the Tiki Cat wet treats in a tube. Those are in the same cabinet as the food, one shelf up. They might be shoved behind some things. 

## Brands
Their current wet food and kibble is: Natural Balance, Limited Ingredient Duck and Green Pea. 

## Kibble
We have a schmancy automatic feeder that we haven't set up. 
Our old one, we had drop at 10pm and then again at like 4am so that Corrigan wouldn't wake us up.
