# Emergency Plan 

In the very bottom drawer of the dresser that the tank is Pip's emergency gear. 

There's a tupperware tub with air holes already in it, and a whole bunch of hand warmers. 

To transport him, activate 1 hand warmer and put it in a sock. Then fold up a mediumish hand towel and put both Pip and the hand warmer in the tub. 

Follow whatever the guidance on the hand warmers for how frequently to swap em out.
