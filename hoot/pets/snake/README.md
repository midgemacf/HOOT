Pip the ball python! He is honestly closer to furniture than a pet, so should be low effort. 

If anything is wrong with his levels, his monitor beeps super loud. Can't miss it. Take a look at tank info for the common reasons it beeps.  


Feel free to take him out and hang with him. He's lively for a python, usually spreads right out and tries to go up sleeves. He has not bitten anyone the entire time that we've had him!

The only task that is frequent is to make sure he has water in his bowl, and that his tank is decent humidity: 

* Fill a cup of water from the filter and pour it into the bowl
* Then pour some more filtered water into each corner of tank
  * The goal here is to get water down into the bottom layer of the substrate
  * It's bad for their scales to be sitting directly on wet soil for an extended period of time, but to keep the ambient humidity up the water has to get in there somewhere.
