# Feeding 

He gets 1 "medium" rat every other week. 

We buy them online in bulk and keep them in the chest freezer. 

What I normally do is: 
1. Day before feeding, take an individually bagged rat and put it in the fridge to start thawing
   * I usually put the rat into an old take out style tupperware
   * It has "Rat" written on it in silver, it's usually stored in the cabinet under the toaster/ air frier
   * I am also sometimes too lazy and just put the bagged rat in on its own
1. About 2-3 hours before feeding (usually like 5pm), I take the rat and put it in a bowl of warm water
   * There is a white/tan mixing bowl with "Rat" written on it that I use for this
   * I just put the bagged rat in there with tap water at its highest heat
1. When the rat is fully thawed through and roughly room temperature, it's time to feed him!
1. I use the electric kettle, and boil water to the lowest setting
1. Then, put the rat into the blue plastic cup labelled "RAT" and pour the kettle water in there
1. Take a whole bunch of paper towels (6 rectangles worth, usually) into the office with the tongs and the rat
1. I pull out the top drawer of the dresser, and then use that as a work surface
1. Take the rat out of the water, and pat it dry with the paper towels
   * I usually just place it on one half, and fold the paper over top
1. Then go ahead and open the tank, and do the "death dance" with the rat
   * Make sure to skitter it around a bit to get his attention

He usually strikes pretty quick. If he doesn't, I usually place the rat under the heat lamp overnight. If it's still there in the morning, take a zip lock and take it out and toss it.
