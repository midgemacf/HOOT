## Command center
There's a neat little thing to keep track and it beeps so loud when things are out of range. 
I've labelled all the cables coming out of the home base, to make trouble shooting easier. 

If the power does go out, that thing keeps track of all the settings so it's not like a clock you have to reset (thank god)

## Common Issues
### Heat out of whack
Since the monitor manages the temperatures, and can pump both of the heat sources based on their readings, the heat sensor usually only goes off for one reason: 

A cat turned off the lamp. 

There's a switch on the cable at the top of the tank, that the boys will sometimes step on and turn off when they are trying to nap against the heat lamp. First port of call is to just flip that the other way, and wait to see if the temp starts to go up. 


There are _two_ heat sources, one of them is mounted to the underside of the tank and the cats can't get to it, so even if the cats do turn one off he should be good for the forseeable future.


### Low Humidity 
Copy pasted from main snake page:
> * Fill a cup of water from the filter and pour it into the bowl
> * Then pour some more filtered water into each corner of tank
>  * The goal here is to get water down into the bottom layer of the substrate
>  * It's bad for their scales to be sitting directly on wet soil for an extended period of time, but to keep the ambient humidity up the water has to get in there somewhere.

If it's beeping like crazy for humidity, the sensor for that is in the back right corner, the little silver thing just above the soil. It will stop if you just pour some water on it, since then it reads as 100% humidity. That buys you some time without it beeping to get the soil wet. 

## Spot cleaning
If he poops, we just take it out with a paper towel/zip lock bag and usually either drop it right into the cat's litter genie thing or toss it in the kitchen trash.

There's a reptile safe disinfectant in the spray bottle on top of the tank.
