## Freezers
We have both a chest freezer and a stand up freezer in the garage!

Help yourself to stuff in there, or if you need to store anything there's usually space there too 
## Tools
Obviously we have a ton of tools in there!

There's basic stuff in the wide drawers just to the left of the door into the house. I (Midgie) usually find what I'm looking for in the top two drawers in there... lol
