## Lights
We have smart lights from ikea! [Here's a link to the manual](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/manuals/tradfri-remote-control__AA-2144721-1_pub.pdf), but it's not too hard to figure out. You can control the temperature (white light, warm light, and ranges between) and the brightness!

There is 1x white remote that controls the main fixture as well as the two headed fixture in the corner. That remote is normally mounted on the mail holder, just inside the kitchen. 

Then there is another remote of the same type for the 5-bulb fixture above the sink. That remove is on the cabinet right there. 

In order to control the fan on that main fixture, there is a different remote that is kept on the middle shelf above the butcher block. That has 3 speeds for the fan. We keep the remote for the stairwell light fixture too. 

Sometimes the cats step on those remotes and turn on the fans, and scare the hell out of us. Heads up. 

## Water
The tap water is totally drinkable, we had it tested. But, if you are nervous (or if it's for the snake) we have a fancy osmosis filter as well. That comes out of the spigot to the left corner of the sink. 

That water gets run through a double osmosis filter under the sink, it's quite slow to fill so I usually just use the normal faucet. 

## Dishwasher
We run that thing pretty much every day 2x a day... Every dish I own goes in the dishwasher. Either it's fine or it gets destroyed. I refuse to hand-wash anything. So, rather it get destroyed than sit in a cabinet unused forever.

It takes powder, which we keep under the kitchen sink on both the left side, above the trash bags, and on the far right side. (Jamie and Midgie couldn't agree on where to put it, so compromised in getting 2 and putting it both places)

It is also super finicky to get the button to work. A soft press, slightly off center, has the best results...

## Freezer
It has an ice maker!! 

We keep wax melts in there, and then anything we are going to use frequently/soon. We have _two_ freezers in the garage, a chest and a stand up one, so most stuff is stored down there.

## Weird locations: 
* **Silverware**:  
  * That is in the left door of the butcher block 
* **Drinks**: 
  * In the dining room, on the dog's toy chest
  * In the mini fridge in Jamie's office. 
* Some travel mugs, and anything that just didn't fit in the cabinets, are in the hutch in the dining room.
