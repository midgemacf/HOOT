## Wifi
* **Network**: Deimos
* **Password**: `39990426`

There's also a `Deimos5` which is 5g, so a bit better overall, but it's only strong in a couple places and gets stalled out. I normally am more than fine with just plain `Deimos`.

## Lights
So for whatever reason the previous owner only had remotes for some of the lights.... we've added labels to most of the lights to try and help everything along. 

## Trash Schedule
Normal trash (green barrel) comes every Monday, we put it out sunday. 

If for whatever reason you have more trash than can fit in the barrel, you have to use town bags to get the rest taken. 
We keep a roll of those under the sink in the kitchen for emergencies!

The recycling (blue barrels) is taken on alternating Mondays... you can look up the schedule on the 
[town website](https://www.londonderrynh.gov/environmental-services-solid-waste), but we honestly just see when our 
neighbors put them out and go off that. We have 3 of them, and usually only fill one, *maybe* two, per collection so we can
easily miss a cycle and not be in trouble.

## Power Outages
We have a generator! It comes on every week on Tuesdays to keep everything primed. It comes on automatically whenever we lose power. 

It runs off of the gas tank out back. When we moved in and got the generator served, they told us to check the levels on 
the tank roughly every 4 hours that it runs to make sure it doesn't eat through all of it. 

We've never had it on for more than an hour the whole time we've lived here though hah.

The shrimp tank's sensor does not remember where it was before an outage, so you may have to deal with that. 

The snake tank's sensor _does_ remember though, so no need to worry about all the different settings.
